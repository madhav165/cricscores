This program displays the teams playing cricket and their respective scores in the terminal. The data is obtained from www.espncricinfo.com. Additionl information is stored in the MatchObject objects which can be accessed if needed, with slight changes to the code.

This works best with a maximized terminal.

On UNIX:
Run with java -cp .:$PATH_TO_FOLDER/jsoup-1.9.2.jar:$PATH_TO_FOLDER CricketScores

On Windows:
Run with java -cp .;$PATH_TO_FOLDER/jsoup-1.9.2.jar;$PATH_TO_FOLDER CricketScores

Linux users may be able to add a shortcut to the run command as follows:
1) Open ~/.bash_aliases
2) Type 'alias cricscores="java -cp.:$PATH_TO_FOLDER/jsoup-1.9.2.jar:$PATH_TO_FOLDER CricketScores
3) Save the file
4) Type 'source ~/.bash_aliases'
5) The command 'cricscores' in the command prompt should now work with the same functionality
